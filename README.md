This project is a mobile application developed using Flutter in Android Studio. The Grocery Store App aims to provide users with a convenient way to manage their grocery shopping needs and making purchases.

## Database

The app utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store and manage various aspects of the grocery store application. Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that allows for real-time synchronization and data updates across multiple clients.

## Tables/Collections

The following are the main data structures utilized within Firebase Realtime Database for the Grocery Store App:

1. Users: This node stores information about the users of the application, including their login credentials.
2. Products: The Products node contains details about the various grocery items available for purchase in the store. Each product entry includes information such as the product name, image and price.
3. Carts: The Carts node records the details of user orders placed through the app. It includes information such as the user ID, user details, list of purchased items, total price, and timestamp.
